        "text": "The first \"real-world study\" into the effectiveness of a weight loss drug is set to measure the impact on the job prospects of people living with obesity in Greater Manchester.\nThe five-year clinical trial was announced as part of a £279m plans by US pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly to work with the UK government to address public health challenges like obesity.\nThe anti-obesity drug Tirzepatide, created by Eli Lilly and sold under the brand names Mounjaro and Zepbound, will be used in the study.\nIllnesses relating to obesity cost the NHS £11bn a year, Health Secretary Wes Streeting said.\nThe trial will be run by Health Innovation Manchester in partnership with Eli Lilly, along with the University of Manchester and local digital trials company NorthWest EHealth.\nThe group of Greater Manchester health organisations behind the study have not revealed exactly who will be given the drugs.\nBut up to 3,000 people in the city-region will eventually take part, those behind the project have said.\nThey say the study will examine the \"real-world\" effectiveness of tirzepatide on weight loss, and on preventing diabetes and obesity-related complications.\nResearchers will also measure how the drug affects the employment status of a patient, as well as the number of sick days they take.\nThe trial will make use of the Greater Manchester Care Record - an innovative joined up database of patient information from health and social care providers in the region.\nAbout 600,000 adults live with obesity in Greater Manchester, according to Mark Fisher, chief executive officer of the NHS Greater Manchester Integrated Care Board.\nHe said the condition \"reduces their quality of life and puts additional pressure on the health and care system\" and welcomed the study in his region.\nMayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, said: \"Greater Manchester is world-renowned as a hub for innovation in health and life sciences.\"\nLaura Rooney, director of strategy at Health Innovation Manchester, said the announcement of the trials was a “huge achievement”, and testament to strength of the health and care and academic sectors in the city.\nThe researchers said the plan was to release more details about the study at a later date.\nAll the evidence gathered from the five-year trial will be used to demonstrate the long-term effect of weight loss medication.\nThose behind the study say the results could help develop the care pathways set by health services for treating people with obesity.\nMartin Rutter, who is a professor of Cardiometabolic Medicine at the University of Manchester said the trial would test the long-term effectiveness of the drug in the \"real-world\".\nProf Rutter, who is the lead investigator for the trial, said the the results would look into how the drugs works in \"a primary care setting compared to usual care\".\nPrimary care is the first point of contact for health care for most people and is mainly provided by GPs, but would also include community pharmacists, opticians and dentists.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Manchester on Sounds and follow BBC Manchester on Facebook, X, and Instagram.
